‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Disclaimer**: [Your Tool Name] is a research and educational tool. It is designed for responsible use only. It is not for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works - Decoding Crypto with Brute Force

[Your Tool Name] uses a brute-force strategy, meticulously generating and checking potential crypto wallets. It utilizes [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin and [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing for EVM chains.

The program compares generated wallet addresses against known address databases or checks their balances in real-time via blockchain explorers. The C++ engine provides speed.

## Why [Your Tool Name] is the Key to Unlocking Wallets?

Unlike many other crypto brute-force tools, **[Your Tool Name]** is crafted in C++, and it's optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU performance, delivering a significant speed advantage ‚Äì up to **10x faster**. If you are looking to recover lost wallets, analyze vulnerabilities, or simply to deepen your knowledge of the crypto space, [Your Tool Name] equips you with both speed and power.

## Brute Force in Action: Searching for Wallets

**[Your Tool Name]** allows you to search for wallets by brute-forcing.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Searches:

*   Press 3 or run `start_search_btc.bat` ‚Äì Check balances through the internet (slower).
*   Press 6 to use the database - for speed.

### EVM Wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press 5 or run `start_search_evm.bat` to check.
*   Press 6 to search using the database.

### Speeding Up the Process:

*   The speed depends on your GPU. Run multiple instances (1-4) for greater speed.
*   Databases significantly help.

## Found a Wallet? What to Do Next & Security!

When a wallet with a balance is found:

*   The program stops.
*   Wallet details display.
*   Data is saved in ``found_wallets.txt``.

### Accessing Funds (Ethically and Securely)

1.  Import the **seed phrase** to a crypto wallet.
2.  Transfer the funds.

### Important Considerations

*   The seed phrase should be 12 words.
*   Use * for missing words.
*   Brute-forcing can take time.
*   The program stops if a wallet is found.
